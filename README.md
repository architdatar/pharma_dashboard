# Pharma dashboard Version 1.0
Automates web search to scrape data from websites and get interesting insights from it. 

## Process so far
Go to duckduckgo.com -> Search "pfizer abc news" to get mentions of Pfizer on ABC news. -> Scrape text from the links available -> Store it in a JSON file. 

## Future directions
1. Get data for more relevant keywords and websites to generate a good database. 
2. Get insights from this database using simple tools like counts, etc., and eventually, more complex structures like pharma ontologies.
3. Build dashboards to visualize and communicate these findings. 

## Known errors / issues
1. There are many websites that cannot currenly be scraped properly. Those will need to be fixed in future.
